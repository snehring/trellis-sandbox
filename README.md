# Trellis sandbox
This is derived from [this example](https://github.com/stratum/stratum/tree/master/tools/mininet/examples/trellis) in this stratum github and is mostly me messing around

This sets up a 2 spine 4 leaf network with 9 hosts, 5 of which are lacp bonded on a paired switch

start the network first
then start onos
then push the config to onos
username is onos
password is rocks
